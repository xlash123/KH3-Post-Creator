# KH3 Post Creator
This is a simple tool that allows you to upload any image and text to dynamically create a KH3-like post. This will be great for presenting your memorable screen shots. Or memes. Memes are good too.

## How to Use
This tool is fairly simple to use. All you have to do is select who is making the post, type in the body text, upload a photo, and save your results!

Everything is dynamically updated, so you will always be able to see the preview of your post.

## Bugs
This website is in the beta stages of development, so feel free to report any bugs in the issues tab. The website design/layout is also very basic since I really suck at CSS. This means that it looks very bland and doesn't work on mobile devices.

I plan to make changes to make the site more aesthetically pleasing as well as add functionality for mobile devices. If you know a thing or two about actual web design, please message me or submit a pull request. I'll take any help I can get.
